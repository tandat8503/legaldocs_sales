ยง 7-302. Through Bills of Lading and Similar Documents of Title.

(a)
The
issuer
of a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier is liable to any person entitled to recover on the document for any breach by the other person or the performing carrier of its obligation under the document. However, to the extent that the bill covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.
(b)
If
goods
covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the
issuer
are received by that person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer. The person's obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.
(c)
The
issuer
of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection (a) is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possession of the
goods
when the breach of the obligation under the document occurred:
(1) the amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript of judgment, and;
(2) the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any action commenced by any person entitled to recover on the document for the breach.
