ยง 4-214. RIGHT OF CHARGE-BACK OR REFUND; LIABILITY OF COLLECTING BANK; RETURN OF ITEM.
(a) If a
collecting bank
has made provisional
settlement
with its
customer
for an
item
and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a
bank
, or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer's
account
, or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its
midnight deadline
or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts. If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank's midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge back the credit, or obtain refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. These rights to revoke, charge back, and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final .
(b) A
collecting bank
returns an
item
when it is sent or delivered to the
bank's
customer
or transferor or pursuant to its instructions.
(c) A
depositary bank
that is also the payor may charge back the amount of an
item
to its
customer's
account
or obtain refund in accordance with the section governing return of an item received by a
payor bank
for credit on its books (Section
4-301
).
(d) The right to charge back is not affected by:
(1) previous use of a credit given for the
item
; or
(2) failure by any
bank
to exercise ordinary care with respect to the
item
, but a bank so failing remains liable.
(e) A failure to charge back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the
bank
against the
customer
or any other party.
(f) If credit is given in dollars as the equivalent of the value of an
item
payable in foreign money, the dollar amount of any charge-back or refund must be calculated on the basis of the bank-offered spot rate for the foreign money prevailing on the day when the person entitled to the charge-back or refund learns that it will not receive payment in ordinary course.
