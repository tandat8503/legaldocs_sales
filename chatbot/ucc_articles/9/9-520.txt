ยง 9-520. ACCEPTANCE AND REFUSAL TO ACCEPT RECORD.
(a) [Mandatory refusal to accept
	record.]
A
filing office
shall refuse
	to accept a
record
for filing for a reason set forth
	in Section
9-516(b)
and may refuse to accept a record
	for filing only for a reason set forth in Section
9-516(b)
.
(b) [Communication concerning refusal.]
If a
filing office
refuses
	to accept a
record
for filing, it shall
communicate
to
	the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal
	and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office
	accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed
	by
filing-office rule
but [, in the case of
	a filing office described in Section
9-501(a)
(2),] in
	no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record.
(c) [When filed financing statement
	effective.]
A filed
financing statement
satisfying
	Section
9-502(a)
and
(b)
is effective,
	even if the
filing office
is required to refuse
	to accept it for filing under subsection (a). However, Section
9-338
applies
	to a filed financing statement providing information described in Section
9-516(b)
(5)
	which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed.
(d) [Separate application to multiple
	debtors.]
If a
record
communicated
to
	a
filing office
provides information that relates
	to more than one
debtor
, this part applies as to each
	debtor separately.
