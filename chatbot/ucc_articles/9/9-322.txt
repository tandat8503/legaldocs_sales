ยง 9-322. PRIORITIES AMONG CONFLICTING SECURITY INTERESTS IN AND AGRICULTURAL LIENS ON SAME COLLATERAL.
(a) [General priority rules.]
Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority
	among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral
	is determined according to the following rules:
(1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural
	liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates
	from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made
	or the security interest or
agricultural lien
is
	first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing
	nor perfection.
(2) A perfected security interest or
agricultural
		lien
has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural
		lien.
(3) The first security interest or
agricultural
		lien
to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security
		interests and agricultural liens are unperfected.
(b) [Time of perfection: proceeds
	and supporting obligations.]
For the purposes of subsection (a)(1):
(1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security
	interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security
	interest in
proceeds
; and
(2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security
	interest in collateral supported by a
supporting
	obligation
is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest
	in the supporting obligation.
(c) [Special priority rules: proceeds
	and supporting obligations.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security
	interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security
	interest under Section
9-327
,
9-328
,
9-329
,
9-330
,
	or
9-331
also has priority over a conflicting security
	interest in:
(1) any
supporting obligation
for
	the collateral; and
(2)
proceeds
of the collateral
	if:
(A) the security interest in proceeds is perfected;
(B) the proceeds are
cash proceeds
or
	of the same type as the collateral; and
(C) in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds,
	all intervening proceeds are
cash proceeds
, proceeds
	of the same type as the collateral, or an
account
relating
	to the collateral.
(d) [First-to-file priority rule
	for certain collateral.]
Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided
	in subsection (f), if a security interest in
chattel
	paper
,
deposit accounts
, negotiable documents,
instruments
,
investment
	property
, or
letter-of-credit rights
is
	perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests
	in
proceeds
of the collateral rank according to priority
	in time of filing.
(e) [Applicability of subsection
	(d).]
Subsection (d) applies only if the
proceeds
of
	the collateral are not
cash proceeds
,
chattel
	paper
, negotiable documents,
instruments
,
investment
	property
, or
letter-of-credit rights
.
(f) [Limitations on subsections (a)
	through (e).]
Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to:
(1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part;
(2) Section
4-210
with
	respect to a security interest of a collecting
bank
;
(3) Section
5-118
with
	respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person; and
(4) Section
9-110
with respect to
	a security interest arising under Article 2 or 2A.
(g) [Priority under agricultural
	lien statute.]
A perfected
agricultural
		lien
on collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in
		or agricultural lien on the same collateral if the statute creating the agricultural
		lien so provides.
