(a) [Five-year effectiveness.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e),
	(f), and (g), a filed
financing statement
is
	effective for a period of five years after the date of filing.
(b) [Public-finance or manufactured-home
	transaction.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f),
	and (g), an initial
financing statement
filed
	in connection with a
public-finance transaction

	transaction
is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing
	if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction
	or manufactured-home transaction.
(c) [Lapse and continuation of financing
	statement.]
The effectiveness of a filed
financing
		statement
lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless
		before the lapse a
continuation statement
is
		filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases
		to be effective and any security interest or
agricultural
		lien
that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected,
		unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest
		or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to
		have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.
(d) [When continuation statement
	may be filed.]
A
continuation statement
may
	be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period
	specified in subsection (a) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (b),
	whichever is applicable.
(e) [Effect of filing continuation
	statement.]
Except as otherwise provided in Section
9-510
,
	upon timely filing of a
continuation statement
,
	the effectiveness of the initial

continues

	would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration
	of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as
	provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement
	is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation statements may
	be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing
	statement.
(f) [Transmitting utility financing
	statement.]
If a
debtor
is a
transmitting
		utility
and a filed initial
financing statement
so
		indicates, the financing statement is effective until a
termination
		statement
is filed.
(g) [Record of mortgage as financing
	statement.]
A record of a
mortgage
that is
	effective as a
financing statement
filed
	as a
fixture filing
under Section
9-502(c)
remains
	effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage
	is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates
	as to the real property.
