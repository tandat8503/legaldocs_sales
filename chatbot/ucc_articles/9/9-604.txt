ยง 9-604. PROCEDURE IF SECURITY AGREEMENT COVERS REAL PROPERTY OR FIXTURES.
(a) [Enforcement: personal and real
	property.]
If a
security agreement
covers
	both personal and real property, a
secured party
may
	proceed:
(1) under this part as to the personal property without
	prejudicing any rights with respect to the real property; or
(2) as to both the personal property and the real property
	in accordance with the rights with respect to the real property, in which case
	the other provisions of this part do not apply.
(b) [Enforcement: fixtures.]
Subject to subsection (c), if a
security
		agreement
covers
goods
that are or become
fixtures
,
		a
secured party
may proceed:
(1) under this part; or
(2) in accordance with the rights with respect to real
	property, in which case the other provisions of this part do not apply.
(c) [Removal of fixtures.]
Subject to the other provisions of this part, if a
secured
		party
holding a security interest in
fixtures
has
		priority over all owners and encumbrancers of the real property, the secured
		party, after default, may remove the collateral from the real property.
(d) [Injury caused by removal.]
A
secured party
that removes
	collateral shall promptly reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real property,
	other than the
debtor
, for the cost of repair of any
	physical injury caused by the removal. The secured party need not reimburse
	the encumbrancer or owner for any diminution in value of the real property caused
	by the absence of the
goods
removed or by any necessity
	of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission
	to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance
	of the obligation to reimburse.
