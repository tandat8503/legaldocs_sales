Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), for purposes
	of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of
goods
from,
	a

	of the consignee, the consignee is deemed to have rights and title to the goods
	identical to those the
consignor
had or had power
	to transfer.
(b) [Applicability of other law.]

	a
consignee
, law other than this article determines
	the rights and title of a consignee while

	held by the
consignor
would have priority over the
	rights of the creditor.
