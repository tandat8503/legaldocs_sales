ยง 9-326. PRIORITY OF SECURITY INTERESTS CREATED BY NEW DEBTOR.
(a) [Subordination of security interest
	created by new debtor.]
Subject to subsection (b), a security interest that is created
	by a
new debtor
in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights and is perfected solely by a filed
financing
	statement
that would be ineffective to perfect the security interest but for the application of Section
9-316(i)(1)
or
9-508
is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by such a filed financing statement.
(b) [Priority under other provisions;
	multiple original debtors.]
The other provisions of this part determine the priority
	among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed
financing
	statements
described in
         
          subsection (a)
         
         .
	However, if the security agreements to which a
new debtor
became
	bound as debtor were not entered into by the same
original
	debtor
, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in
	time of the new debtor's having become bound.
