§ 9-407. RESTRICTIONS ON CREATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY INTEREST IN LEASEHOLD INTEREST OR IN LESSOR’S RESIDUAL INTEREST.
(a) [Term restricting assignment
	generally ineffective.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term
	in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it:
(1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a
	party to the lease to the the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of
	a security interest in an interest of a party under the lease contract or in
	the lessor's residual interest in the
goods
; or
(2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection,
	or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach,
	right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy
	under the lease.
(b) [Effectiveness of certain terms.]
Except as otherwise provided in Section
2A-303
(7),
	a term described in subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there
	is:
(1) a transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of
	possession or use of the
goods
in violation of the term;
	or
(2) a delegation of a material performance of either party
	to the lease contract in violation of the term.
(c) [Security interest not material
	impairment.]
The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of
	a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the
	lessor's residual interest in the
goods
is not a transfer
	that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance
	or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk
	imposed on the lessee within the purview of Section
2A-303
(4)
	unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a
	delegation of material performance of the lessor.
