ยง 9-507. EFFECT OF CERTAIN EVENTS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF FINANCING STATEMENT.
(a) [Disposition.]
A filed
financing statement
remains
	effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed,
	or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or
agricultural
	lien
continues, even if the
secured party
knows
	of or consents to the disposition.
(b) [Information becoming seriously
	misleading.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Section
9-508
,
	a
financing statement
is not rendered ineffective
	if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the
	financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section
9-506
.
(c) [Change in debtor's name.]
If the name 
	that a filed
financing statement
provides for a
debtor
becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under Section
9-503(a)
so that the financing statement becomes
	seriously misleading under Section
9-506
:
(1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a
	security interest in collateral acquired by the
debtor
before,
	or within four months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and
(2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect
	a security interest in collateral acquired by the
debtor
more
	than four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement
	which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within
	four months after the financing statement became seriously misleading.
