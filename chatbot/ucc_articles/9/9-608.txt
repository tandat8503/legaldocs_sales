ยง 9-608. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF COLLECTION OR ENFORCEMENT; LIABILITY FOR DEFICIENCY AND RIGHT TO SURPLUS.
(a) [Application of proceeds, surplus,
	and deficiency if obligation secured.]
If a security interest or
agricultural
		lien
secures payment or performance of an obligation, the following rules
		apply:
(1) A
secured party
shall
	apply or pay over for application the
cash proceeds
of
	collection or enforcement under Section 9-607 in the following order to:
(A) the reasonable expenses of collection and enforcement
	and, to the extent provided for by agreement and not prohibited by law, reasonable
	attorney's fees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;
(B) the satisfaction of obligations secured by the security
	interest or
agricultural lien
under which the
	collection or enforcement is made; and
(C) the satisfaction of obligations secured by any subordinate
	security interest in or other lien on the collateral subject to the security
	interest or
agricultural lien
under which the
	collection or enforcement is made if the secured party receives an
authenticated
demand
	for
proceeds
before distribution of the proceeds is
	completed.
(2) If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate
	security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest
	or lien within a reasonable time. Unless the holder complies, the secured party
	need not comply with the holder's demand under paragraph (1)(C).
(3) A secured party need not apply or pay over for application
noncash
		proceeds
of collection and enforcement under Section 9-607 unless the failure
		to do so would be commercially unreasonable. A secured party that applies or
		pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable
		manner.
(4) A secured party shall account to and pay a
debtor
for
	any surplus, and the
obligor
is liable for any deficiency.
(b) [No surplus or deficiency in
	sales of certain rights to payment.]
If the underlying transaction is a sale of
accounts
,
chattel
		paper
,
payment intangibles
, or
promissory
		notes
, the
debtor
is not entitled to any surplus,
		and the
obligor
is not liable for any deficiency.
