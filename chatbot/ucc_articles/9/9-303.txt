ยง 9-303. LAW GOVERNING PERFECTION AND PRIORITY OF SECURITY INTERESTS IN GOODS COVERED BY A CERTIFICATE OF TITLE.
(a) [Applicability of section.]
This section applies to
goods
covered
	by a
certificate of title
, even if there
	is no other relationship between the jurisdiction under whose certificate of
	title the goods are covered and the goods or the
debtor
.
(b) [When goods covered by certificate
	of title.]
Goods
become covered by a
certificate
		of title
when a valid application for the certificate of title and the
		applicable fee are delivered to the appropriate authority. Goods cease to be
		covered by a certificate of title at the earlier of the time the certificate
		of title ceases to be effective under the law of the issuing jurisdiction or
		the time the goods become covered subsequently by a certificate of title issued
		by another jurisdiction.
(c) [Applicable law.]
The local law of the jurisdiction under whose
certificate
		of title
the
goods
are covered governs perfection,
		the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of a security interest
		in goods covered by a certificate of title from the time the goods become covered
		by the certificate of title until the goods cease to be covered by the certificate
		of title.
