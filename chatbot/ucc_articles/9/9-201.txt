ยง 9-201. GENERAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SECURITY AGREEMENT.
(a) [General effectiveness.]
Except as otherwise provided in [the Uniform Commercial
	Code], a
security agreement
is effective according
	to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral, and
	against creditors.
(b) [Applicable consumer laws and
	other law.]
A transaction subject to this article is subject to any
	applicable rule of law which establishes a different rule for consumers and
	[insert reference to (i) any other statute or regulation that regulates the
	rates, charges, agreements, and practices for loans, credit sales, or other
	extensions of credit and (ii) any consumer-protection statute or regulation].
(c) [Other applicable law controls.]
In case of conflict between this article and a rule of
	law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (b), the rule of law, statute,
	or regulation controls. Failure to comply with a statute or regulation described
	in subsection (b) has only the effect the statute or regulation specifies.
(d) [Further deference to other applicable
	law.]
This article does not:
(1) validate any rate, charge, agreement, or practice
	that violates a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection
	(b); or
(2) extend the application of the rule of law, statute,
	or regulation to a transaction not otherwise subject to it.
