§ 9-625. REMEDIES FOR SECURED PARTY’S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ARTICLE.
(a) [Judicial orders concerning noncompliance.]
If it is established that a
secured
		party
is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order
		or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate
		terms and conditions.
(b) [Damages for noncompliance.]
Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (f), a person is
	liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with
	this article. Loss caused by a failure to comply may
	include loss resulting from the
debtor
's inability to
	obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.
(c) [Persons entitled to recover
	damages; statutory damages in consumer-goods transaction.]
Except as otherwise provided in Section
9-628
:
(1) a person that, at the time of the failure, was a
debtor
,
	was an
obligor
, or held a security interest in or other
	lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss;
	and
(2) if the collateral is
consumer
		goods
, a person that was a
debtor
or a
secondary
		obligor
at the time a
secured party
failed
		to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount
		not less than the credit service charge plus 10 percent of the principal amount
		of the obligation or the time-price differential plus 10 percent of the cash
		price.
(d) [Recovery when deficiency eliminated
	or reduced.]
A
debtor
whose deficiency is eliminated
	under Section
9-626
may recover damages for the loss of
	any surplus. However, a debtor or
secondary obligor
whose
	deficiency is eliminated or reduced under Section
9-626
may
	not otherwise recover under subsection (b) for noncompliance with the provisions
	of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance.
(e) [Statutory damages: noncompliance
	with specified provisions.]
In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection
	(b), the
debtor
,
consumer
	obligor
, or person named as a
debtor
in a filed record,
	as applicable, may recover $500 in each case from a person that:
(1) fails to comply with Section
9-208
;
(2) fails to comply with Section
9-209
;
(3) files a record that the person is not entitled to
	file under Section
9-509(a)
;
(4) fails to cause the
secured
		party
of record to file or
send
a
termination
		statement
as required by Section
9-513(a)
or
(c)
;
(5) fails to comply with Section
9-616(b)
(1)
	and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance;
	or
(6) fails to comply with Section
9-616(b)
(2).
(f) [Statutory damages: noncompliance
	with Section 9-210.]
A
debtor
or
consumer
		obligor
may recover damages under subsection (b) and, in addition, $500
		in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply
		with a request under Section
9-210
. A recipient of a
		request under Section
9-210
which never claimed an interest
		in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that
		section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within
		the meaning of this subsection.
(g) [Limitation of security interest:
	noncompliance with Section 9-210.]
If a
secured party
fails
	to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account
	under Section
9-210
, the secured party may claim a security
	interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a
	person that is reasonably misled by the failure.
