ยง 9-333. PRIORITY OF CERTAIN LIENS ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW.
(a) ["Possessory lien."]

In this section, "possessory lien" means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien :

(1) which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business;

(2) which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and

(3) whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods.

(b) [Priority of possessory lien.]

A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise.
