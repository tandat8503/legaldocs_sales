§ 9-205. USE OR DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL PERMISSIBLE.
(a) [When security interest not invalid
	or fraudulent.]
A security interest is not invalid or fraudulent against
	creditors solely because:

	ability to:
(A) use, commingle, or dispose of all or part of the collateral,
	including returned or repossessed
goods
;
(B) collect, compromise, enforce, or otherwise deal with
	collateral;
(C) accept the return of collateral or make repossessions;
	or
(D) use, commingle, or dispose of
proceeds
;
	or
(2) the
secured party
fails
	to require the
debtor
to account for
proceeds
or
	replace collateral.
(b) [Requirements of possession not
	relaxed.]
This section does not relax the requirements of possession
	if attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest depends upon
	possession of the collateral by the
secured party
