(a) [What constitutes filing.]
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), communication
	of a
record
to a
filing office
and
	tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes
	filing.
(b) [Refusal to accept record; filing
	does not occur.]
Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a
filing
		office
refuses to accept because:
(1) the record is not
communicated
by
	a method or medium of communication authorized by the
filing
	office
;
(2) an amount equal to or greater than the applicable
	filing fee is not tendered;
(3) the
filing office
is
	unable to index the record because:
(A) in the case of an initial
financing
		statement
, the record does not provide a name for the
debtor
;
(B) in the case of an amendment or information statement,
	the record:
(i) does not identify the initial financing statement
	as required by Section
9-512
or
9-518
,
	as applicable; or
(ii) identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness
	has lapsed under Section
9-515
;
(C) in the case of an initial financing statement that
	provides the name of a
debtor
identified as an individual
	or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual
	which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record
	relates, the record does not identify the debtor's last name; or
(D) in the case of a record filed [or recorded] in the
filing
		office
described in Section
9-501(a)
(1), the record
		does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it
		relates;
(4) in the case of an initial
financing
		statement
or an amendment that adds a
secured
		party
of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address
		for the secured party of record;
(5) in the case of an initial
financing
		statement
or an amendment that provides a name of a
debtor
which
		was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment
		relates, the record does not:
(A) provide a mailing address for the debtor; or
(B) indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization; or
(C) if the financing statement indicates that the debtor
	is an organization, provide:
(i) a type of organization for the debtor;
(ii) a
jurisdiction
		of organization
for the debtor; or
(iii) an organizational identification number for the
	debtor or indicate that the debtor has none;
(6) in the case of an assignment reflected in an initial
financing
		statement
under Section
9-514(a)
or an amendment
		filed under Section
9-514(b)
, the record does not provide
		a name and mailing address for the assignee; or
(7) in the case of a
continuation
		statement
, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed
		by Section
9-515(d)
.
(c) [Rules applicable to subsection
	(b).]
For purposes of subsection (b):
(1) a
record
does not provide information
	if the
filing office
is unable to read or decipher
	the information; and
(2) a record that does not indicate that it is an amendment
	or identify an initial
financing statement
to
	which it relates, as required by Section
9-512
,
9-514
,
	or
9-518
, is an initial financing statement.
(d) [Refusal to accept record; record
	effective as filed record.]
A
record
that is
communicated
to
	the
filing office
with tender of the filing fee,
	but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set
	forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a
	purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the
	absence of the record from the files.
