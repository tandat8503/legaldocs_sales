ยง 5-118. Security Interest of Issuer or Nominated Person.

(a) An
issuer
or
nominated person
has a security interest in a document presented under a
letter of credit
and any identifiable proceeds of the collateral to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives
value
for the presentation.
(b) Subject to subsection (c), as long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a), the security interest continues and is subject to Article 9, but:
(1) a security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under Section
9-203(b)
(3);
(2) if the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected; and
(3) if the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument, or a letter of credit, so long as the debtor does not have possession of the document, the security interest is perfected and has priority over a conflicting security interest in the document.
