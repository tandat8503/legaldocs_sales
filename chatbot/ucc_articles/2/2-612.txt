ยง 2-612. "Installment contract"; Breach.
(1) An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of
goods
in separate
lots
to be separately accepted, even though the
contract
contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.
(2) The
buyer
may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the
seller
(3) Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole
contract
there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of
cancellation
or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.
