ยง 2-513. Buyer's Right to Inspection of Goods.
(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where
goods
are tendered or delivered or identified to the
contract for sale
, the
buyer
has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the
seller
is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.
(2) Expenses of inspection must be borne by the
buyer
but may be recovered from the
seller
if the
goods
do not conform and are rejected.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this Article on C.I.F.
contracts
(subsection (3) of Section
2-321
), the
buyer
is not entitled to inspect the
goods
before payment of the price when the contract provides
(a) for delivery "C.O.D." or on other like terms; or
(b) for payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the
goods
are to become available for inspection.
(4) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the
contract
.
