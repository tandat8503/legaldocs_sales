ยง 2-505. Seller's Shipment Under Reservation.
(1) Where the
seller
has identified
goods
to the
contract
by or before shipment:
(a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the
goods
. His procurement of the bill to the order of a
financing agency
or of the
buyer
indicates in addition only the
seller's
expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.
(b) a non-negotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the
goods
as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of Section
2-507
) a non-negotiable bill of lading naming the
buyer
as consignee reserves no security interest even though the
seller
retains possession of the bill of lading.
(2) When shipment by the
seller
with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the
contract for sale
it constitutes an improper
contract
buyer
by shipment and identification of the
goods
to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document.
