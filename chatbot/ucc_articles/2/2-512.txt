ยง 2-512. Payment by Buyer Before Inspection.
(1) Where the
contract
requires payment before inspection non-conformity of the
goods
does not excuse the
buyer
from so making payment unless
(a) the non-conformity appears without inspection; or
(b) despite tender of the required documents the circumstances would justify injunction against honor under the provisions of this Act (Section
5-114
).
(2) Payment pursuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of
goods
or impair the
buyer's
right to inspect or any of his remedies.
