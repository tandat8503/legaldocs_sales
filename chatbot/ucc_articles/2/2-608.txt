ยง 2-608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part.
(1) The
buyer
may revoke his acceptance of a
lot
or
commercial unit
whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it
(a) on the reasonable assumption that its non-conformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or
(b) without discovery of such non-conformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the
seller's
assurances.
(2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the
buyer
discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the
goods
which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the
seller
of it.
(3) A
buyer
who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the
goods
involved as if he had rejected them.
