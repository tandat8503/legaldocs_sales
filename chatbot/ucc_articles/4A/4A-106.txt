ยง 4A-106. TIME	PAYMENT ORDER IS RECEIVED.
(a) The time of receipt of
	a
payment order
or communication cancelling or amending
	a payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice
	stated in Section
1-202
. A
receiving
	bank
may fix a cut-off time or times on a
funds-transfer
	business day
for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications
	cancelling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply
	to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments, or to different categories
	of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply
	to
senders
generally or different cut-off times may apply
	to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order
	or communication cancelling or amending a payment order is received after the
	close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time
	on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order
	or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business
	day.
(b) If this Article refers
	to an
execution date
or
payment
	date
or states a day on which a
receiving bank
is
	required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a
funds-transfer
	business day
, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated
	as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this Article.
