ยง 4A-403. PAYMENT	BY SENDER TO RECEIVING BANK.

(a) Payment of the
sender's
obligation
	under Section
4A-402
to pay the
receiving
	bank
occurs as follows:
(1) If the
sender
is a
bank
,
	payment occurs when the
receiving bank
receives
	final settlement of the obligation through a Federal Reserve Bank or through
	a
funds-transfer system
.
(2) If the
sender
is a
bank
and
	the sender (i) credited an account of the
receiving
	bank
with the sender, or (ii) caused an account of the receiving bank in
	another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or,
	if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable
	and the receiving bank learns of that fact.
(3) If the
receiving bank
debits
	an account of the
sender
with the receiving bank, payment
	occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable
	credit balance in the account.
(b) If the
sender
and
receiving
		bank
are members of a
funds-transfer system
that
		nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives
		final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of
		the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a
payment
		order
transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to
		the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying
		against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment
		from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted
		to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The
		aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank
		in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the
		rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate
		balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The
		aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second
		sentence of this subsection has been exercised.
(c) If two
banks
transmit
payment
		orders
to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations
		of each bank to the other under Section
4A-402
will be
		made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect
		to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount
		owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the
		extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.
(d) In a case not covered
	by subsection (a), the time when payment of the
sender's
obligation
	under Section
4A-402(b)
or
4A-402(c)
occurs
	is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation
	is satisfied.
