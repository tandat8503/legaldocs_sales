having:
(i) a
value
, net of liens and security
	interests, of less than $10,000. If a
debt
is secured
	by
assets
and other property of the seller, the net value
	of the assets is determined by subtracting from their value an amount equal
	to the product of the debt multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which
	is the value of the assets on the
date of the bulk
	sale

	on the
date of the bulk-sale agreement
;

	about the sale may be made, if different from the seller's address; and (v)

debts
owed
	to
claimants
of whom the buyer has knowledge on the
	date the buyer receives the list of claimants from the seller or completes a
	reasonable inquiry to discover the claimants.
(5) The notice under subsections
	(3)(j)(iii) and (3)(k)(iii) must state: (i) that a sale that may constitute
	a

	or prospective
date of the bulk sale

	the individual, partnership, or corporate names and the addresses of the seller
	and buyer; (iv) the address to which inquiries about the sale may be made, if
	different from the seller's address; and (v) that the buyer has assumed or will
	assume the
debts
that were incurred in the seller's business
	before the date of the bulk sale.
(6) For purposes of subsection
	(3)(l), the
value
of
assets
is presumed
	to be equal to the price the buyer agrees to pay for the assets. However,
	in a sale by auction or a sale conducted by a
liquidator
on
	the seller's behalf, the value of assets is presumed to be the amount the
auctioneer
or
	liquidator reasonably estimates the assets will bring at auction or upon liquidation.
