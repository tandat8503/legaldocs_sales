ยง 3-203. TRANSFER	OF INSTRUMENT; RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY TRANSFER.
(a) An
instrument
is
	transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its
issue
r
	for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce
	the instrument.
(b) Transfer of an
instrument
,
	whether or not the transfer is a
negotiation
, vests
	in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including
	any right as a
holder in due course
, but the
	transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly
	or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud
	or illegality affecting the instrument.
(c) Unless otherwise agreed,
	if an
instrument
is transferred for value and the
	transferee does not become a holder because of lack of
indorsement
by
	the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified
	indorsement of the transferor, but
negotiation
of
	the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.
(d) If a transferor purports
	to transfer less than the entire
instrument
,
negotiation
of
	the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under
	this Article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.
