ยง 3-309. ENFORCEMENT	OF LOST, DESTROYED, OR STOLEN INSTRUMENT.
(a) A person not in possession
	of an
instrument
is entitled to enforce the instrument
	if:
(1) the person seeking to enforce the instrument
(A) was entitled to enforce it the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred, or
(B) has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the
	instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss
	of possession occurred;
(2) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer
	by the person or a lawful seizure; and
(3) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of
	the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot
	be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a
	person that cannot	be found or is not amenable to service of process.
(b) A person seeking enforcement
	of an
instrument
under subsection (a) must
prove
the
	terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If
	that proof is made, Section
3-308
applies to the case
	as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The
	court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless
	it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected
	against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce
	the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable
	means.
