	overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment,
	and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured.
(2) If the principal is not payable in installments
	and the due date has not been accelerated, the
instrument
becomes
	overdue on the day after the due date.
(3) If a due date with respect to principal has
	been accelerated, the
instrument
becomes overdue on
	the day after the accelerated due date.
(c) Unless the due date of
	principal has been accelerated, an
instrument
does
	not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default
	in payment of principal.
