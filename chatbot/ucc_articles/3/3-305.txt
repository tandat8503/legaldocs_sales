ยง 3-305. DEFENSES	AND CLAIMS IN RECOUPMENT.
(a) Except as otherwise provided
	in this section, the right to enforce the obligation of a
party
to
	pay an
instrument
is subject to the following:
(1) a defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the
	obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract, (ii) duress, lack
	of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law,
	nullifies the obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor
	to sign the
instrument
with neither knowledge nor
	reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or
	(iv) discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings;
(2) a defense of the obligor stated in another section
	of this Article or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the
person
	entitled to enforce
the
instrument
were enforcing
	a right to payment under a simple contract; and
(3) a claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original
	payee of the
instrument
if the claim arose from the
	transaction that gave rise to the instrument; but the claim of the obligor may
	be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount
	owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.
(b) The right of a
holder
		in due course
to enforce the obligation of a
party
to
		pay the
instrument
is subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(1), but is not subject to defenses of the
		obligor stated in subsection (a)(2) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection
		(a)(3) against a person other than the holder.
(c) Except as stated in subsection
	(d), in an action to enforce the obligation of a
party
to
	pay the
instrument
, the obligor may not assert against
	the
person entitled to enforce
the instrument
	a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument (Section
3-306
)
	of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted
	by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts
	the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor
	is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the
	instrument does not have rights of a
holder in
	due course
and the obligor
proves
that the instrument
	is a lost or stolen instrument.
(d) In an action to enforce
	the obligation of an accommodation
party
to pay an
instrument
,
	the accommodation party may assert against the
person
	entitled to enforce
the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under
	subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled
	to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings,
	infancy, and lack of legal capacity.
(e) In a
consumer
		transaction
, if law other than this article requires that an instrument
		include a statement to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee
		are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could assert against the
		original payee, and the instrument does not include such a statement: (1) the
		instrument has the same effect as if the instrument included such a statement;
		(2) the issuer may assert against the holder or transferee all claims and defenses
		that would have been available if the instrument included such a statement;
		and (3) the extent to which claims may be asserted against the holder or transferee
		is determined as if the instrument included such a statement.
(f) This section is subject to law
	other than this article that establishes a different rule for
consumer
	transactions
.
