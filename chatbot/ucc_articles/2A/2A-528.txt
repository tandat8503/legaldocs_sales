) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties ( Sections
1-102(3)
and
2A-503

lessor
elects to retain the
goods
or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section

, or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the
lessee
as damages for a default of the type described in Section

(a), or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee, (i) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor, (ii) the
present value
as of the date determined under clause (i) of the total rent for the then remaining
lease

lessee
, together with any incidental damages allowed under Section
2A-530
