§ 2A-206. OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE IN FORMATION OF LEASE CONTRACT.
(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances, an offer to make a
lease contract
must be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.
(2) If the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.
