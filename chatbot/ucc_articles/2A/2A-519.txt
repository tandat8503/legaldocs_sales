(1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the
lease agreement
(Section
2A-504
) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties ( Sections
1-102(3)
and
2A-503
), if a
lessee
elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under Section
2A-518(2)
, or is by
purchase
or otherwise, the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the
lessor
or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the
present value
, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining
lease
term of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
(2) Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
(3) Except as otherwise agreed, if the
lessee
has accepted
goods
and given notification (Section
2A-516(3)
), the measure of damages for non-conforming tender or delivery or other default by a
lessor
is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.
(4) Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the
present value
at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the
goods
accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the
lease
term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the
lessor's
default or breach of warranty.
