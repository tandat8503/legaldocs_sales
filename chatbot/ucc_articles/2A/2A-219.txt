ยง 2A-219. RISK OF LOSS.
(1) Except in the case of a
finance lease
, risk of loss is retained by the
lessor
and does not pass to the
lessee
. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.
(2) Subject to the provisions of this Article on the effect of default on risk of loss (Section
2A-220
), if risk of loss is to pass to the
lessee
and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:
(a) If the
lease contract
requires or authorizes the
goods
to be shipped by carrier
(i) and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the
lessee
when the
goods
are duly delivered to the carrier; but
(ii) if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the
goods
are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the
lessee
when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.
(b) If the
goods
are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the
lessee
on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods.
(c) In any case not within subsection (a) or (b), the risk of loss passes to the
lessee
on the lessee's receipt of the
goods
if the
lessor
, or, in the case of a
finance lease
, the
supplier
, is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.
